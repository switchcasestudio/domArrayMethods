# _DOM Array Methods Project_

#### By **Moshe Atia**

 This project, part of Brad Traversy's '20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript' course on Udemy, visually demonstrates the usage of various JavaScript array methods including map(), filter(), sort(), and reduce(). By interfacing with the Random User Generator API, the project retrieves user data, applies these array methods, and displays the results in a user-friendly format.

## Functionality

This project, following Brad Traversy's course, begins by making three API calls to fetch random users from the Random User Generator API. Each user's name and a random money value are extracted from the response.

The user data is displayed on the webpage, with buttons provided to manipulate the data through various array methods:

* Add User: Fetches a new user and adds them to the current list.
Double Money: Doubles the money value for all users using the map() method.
* Show Only Millionaires: Filters the users to display only those with more than $1,000,000 using the filter() method.
* Sort by Richest: Sorts the users by their money value in descending order using the sort() method.
* Calculate Entire Wealth: Calculates and displays the total money of all users using the reduce() method.
